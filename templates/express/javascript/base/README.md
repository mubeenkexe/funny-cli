# **Express.js API Boilerplate**

Welcome to the **Express.js API Boilerplate**! This repository provides a pre-configured template to kickstart your Express.js project with a well-organized folder structure, dummy data, and essential utilities. Building an Express.js server from scratch can be repetitive and time-consuming, so this boilerplate aims to simplify the process and save you valuable development time.

---

## **Features**

-   **Organized Folder Structure**: The template uses a modular and scalable folder structure following best practices.
-   **Pre-Configured Middleware**: Includes examples of middleware such as CORS, error handling, and custom response handlers.
-   **API Versioning**: Easily extendable API versioning to maintain backward compatibility.
-   **Dummy Data**: Includes sample controller, routes, repository, and service for quick testing and reference.
-   **Ready-to-Use Utilities**: Common utilities like CORS setup, error handler, and response handlers are included.
-   **Collaboration-Ready**: Designed for collaboration, contributions, and issue tracking.

### **Key Directories**

1. **`src/api`**:

    - Contains versioned APIs. Each version has controllers, routes, and middlewares for modular API development.
    - Example: `src/api/v1/controllers/user.controller.js` manages user-related API logic.

2. **`src/modules`**:

    - Houses core logic split into repositories and services for better separation of concerns.
    - Example: `src/modules/repositories/user.js` interacts with the database, while `src/modules/services/user.service.js` contains business logic.

3. **`src/public`**:

    - A placeholder for static files or sample data, such as `user.json`.

4. **`src/utils`**:

    - Reusable utilities like CORS setup, error handling, and response formatting.
    - Example: `src/utils/errorHandler.js` handles application-wide error responses.

5. **`src/app.js`**:

    - Configures the application, middleware, and routing.

6. **`src/server.js`**:
    - The entry point for running the server.

## **Usage**

1. **Install Dependencies**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. **Run the Server**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. **Access the API**

    - Default port: `http://localhost:3000`
    - Example endpoint: `GET /api/v1/users`

4. **Modify Dummy Data**
    - Replace or extend the provided dummy controllers, routes, services, and repositories as per your requirements.
